# THE-GUESS-GAME

Our word-guessing game will prompt the player to guess a 5-letter word. As the player submits their word guess, the game will provide some feedback as to whether the letters within their guess are in the word to guess.

If the player guesses the correct letter in the correct position, that letter will be filled in on the console. If they guess a correct letter that belongs in the word, but it is in the wrong position, that letter will be added to a list of misplaced letters, and an underscore will be shown in that position on the console. If they guess an incorrect letter that does not belong in the word, that letter will be added to a list of incorrect letters, and an underscore will be shown in that position on the console. The user will have a maximum of 5 tries to guess the word.

With our game rules defined, letâ€™s begin!

# Instructions
Think of a fun name for your game. Set this game title to a variable so that it can be referenced later when we introduce the game to the player.

Before we start coding the game, we need a word bank of words to choose from that our players will try to guess. Within the words.txt file, populate the file with several 5-letter words (we've added a few to help get you started). You can always return to the words.txt file later to either change or add more word choices.
